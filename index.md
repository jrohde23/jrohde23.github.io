## Career Objective

My vision is to become a leading cybersecurity architect who bridges the gap between theoretical security concepts and practical implementation. I'm passionate about:

- **Building resilient systems** that can withstand sophisticated attacks
- **Automating security workflows** to reduce human error and increase efficiency
- **Mentoring the next generation** of cybersecurity professionals
- **Contributing to open-source security tools** that benefit the community

I see myself in 5-10 years as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Principal Security Architect, leading teams that design and implement cutting-edge security solutions for critical infrastructure and emerging technologies.

    <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>

    <p>I’m Justin Rohde, a cybersecurity engineering student at Iowa State University (Class of 2026) with a strong interest in red teaming, secure system design, and turning ideas into shipped tools.</p>

    <p>I approach cybersecurity the same way I’ve approached baseball my entire life: preparation, discipline, and execution under pressure. I’ve played baseball since age three and competed at the JUCO level for two years, learning how to break down complex situations, adapt quickly, and perform when the stakes are high. That mindset carries directly into security work—anticipating adversaries, deeply understanding systems, and staying composed during incidents.</p>

    <p>More recently, I’ve applied that same long-term mindset to bodybuilding. Although I’m new to the sport, it’s reinforced principles I value: consistency over motivation, mastery of fundamentals, and progress through deliberate effort. These lessons mirror how I approach learning and building in cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>Outside of technical work, I enjoy problem solving, teaching others what I learn, and contributing to projects that make security more practical and accessible.</p>

    <h2>Career Objective</h2>

    <p>My goal is to become a cybersecurity architect who bridges the gap between AI and cybersecurity. I’m particularly passionate about:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>Designing resilient systems</strong> that withstand sophisticated attacks</li>
    <li><strong>Automating security workflows</strong> to reduce human error</li>
    <li><strong>Mentoring students and early-career engineers</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Contributing to open-source security tools</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In 5–10 years, I see myself as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Principal Security Architect, leading teams that protect critical infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p>

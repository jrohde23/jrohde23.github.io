    <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>

    <p>I’m Justin Rohde, a cybersecurity engineering student at Iowa State University (Class of 2026) with a deep interest in red teaming, secure system design, and turning ideas into shipped tools.</p>

    <p>I approach cybersecurity the same way I’ve approached baseball my entire life: preparation, discipline, and execution under pressure. I’ve played baseball since I was three years old and spent two years competing at the JUCO level, where I learned how to break down complex situations, adjust quickly, and perform when the stakes are high. That mindset carries directly into security work—anticipating adversaries, studying systems inside and out, and staying composed when things go wrong.</p>

    <p>More recently, I’ve taken that same long-term, process-driven mindset into bodybuilding. While I’m new to the sport, it’s reinforced lessons I already value: consistency beats motivation, fundamentals matter, and meaningful progress is built through deliberate effort over time. Those principles mirror how I learn security—whether I’m hardening systems, automating workflows, or developing offensive tooling.</p>

    <p>Outside of technical work, I enjoy problem solving, teaching others what I learn, and contributing to projects that make security more accessible and practical.</p>

    <h2>Career Objective</h2>

    <p>My long-term goal is to become a cybersecurity architect who bridges the gap between AI and Cybersecurity. I’m especially passionate about:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Designing resilient systems</strong> that withstand sophisticated attacks</li>
      <li><strong>Automating security workflows</strong> to reduce human error and improve reliability</li>
      <li><strong>Mentoring students and early-career engineers</strong> in cybersecurity</li>
      <li><strong>Contributing to open-source security tools</strong> that benefit the broader community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the next 5–10 years, I see myself as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Principal Security Architect, leading teams that build and defend critical infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p>
